/**
 * How many bytes of a declared-oversize body to read before deciding a route.
 *
 * Fixed constant, NOT configurable: the sniff is a fallback for bodies the relay
 * cannot buffer in full, and its purpose is solely to peek the `"model"` key near
 * the start of the JSON object. 8 KiB is generous for any realistic model name.

/**
 * Anchored regex over the leading bytes of a request body.
 *
 * Why anchored: a nested `"model"` key inside `messages` or `tools` can appear at
 * any offset in the body, but the TOP-LEVEL `"model"` field can only be preceded by
 * optional whitespace and the opening `{`.  Anchoring prevents a false match on a
 * deeply nested object whose model key happens to sit within the sniff window.
 *
 * ReDoS safety (matches src/errors.ts pattern):
 *   - Input is bounded to MODEL_SNIFF_BYTES (8 KiB) before the match is run.
 *   - The three alternation arms are mutually exclusive: `[^"\\\x00-\x1f]` matches
 *     any printable non-special character; `\\["\\/bfnrt]` matches escape sequences;
 *     `\\u[0-9a-fA-F]{4}` matches Unicode escapes.  No arm overlaps another.
 *   - Value length is bounded by `{0,200}` — short enough for any model name.
 *
 * Intentional divergence from JSON.parse on duplicate top-level `model` keys: this
 * regex takes the FIRST occurrence; JSON.parse takes the LAST.  This case is only
 * reachable on a body that exceeds the routing window, and in practice no client
 * sends duplicate top-level keys, so the divergence is theoretical.

 *   - the captured literal is malformed JSON (JSON.parse throws), or
 *   - the buffer is empty.
